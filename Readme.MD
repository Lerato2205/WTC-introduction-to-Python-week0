What I've Learned So Far
Git & GitHub
I’ve learned how to create a repository on GitHub and connect it to Visual Studio Code.

I know how to pull changes from GitHub using git pull and push my work using git push.

I can access and edit repositories through VSCode.

I'm still getting used to cloning repositories with git clone, but I’m practicing.

Python Basics
I’ve started learning Python and created a simple file called hello.py.

I can run a Python file using:

python hello.py
This shows the output of whatever I’ve written in the file.

A few helpful terminal commands I’ve learned:

clear – clears the terminal

cp hello.py newfile.py – copies a file

ls – lists the files in the folder

rm filename.py – deletes a file

What I’m Still Working On
Getting more comfortable with cloning repositories.

Practicing more terminal commands and getting used to navigating between folders using cd.

Improving my overall workflow with Git and Python.
